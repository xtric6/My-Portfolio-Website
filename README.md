# My-Portfolio-Website

This repository contains the code for a website that conatins details of the projects I have done. it was made using html,css,javascript and bootstrap. Its an edited template from https://startbootstrap.com/ . This site conatains various templates you can you use for your next project all for free. 
Most of the changing done to the original templates were done inline,although they could be done in the css file,implementing the changes inline will override any previous styling done on the file.

The images used were edited in https://canva.com/ . this is to create uniformity in my images.I used the logo design template of 500px by 500px. Most of the images used were jpg files  and their backgrounds were removed using https://www.remove.bg/ before replacing them with a different background colour using canva.
